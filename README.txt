Introduction
============

The code in this product is responsible for displaying the content-pages
on GroupServer: what we call the "pragmatic templates". It controls
the basic layout of the XHTML 1.0 pages, and the JavaScript that we
use everywhere.

It is slowly being split up into the smaller ``gs.content.*`` products.
